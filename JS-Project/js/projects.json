Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word as well as if the location of the letter in the word is correct. The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses. The word is selected at random from the database. The user will never be able to guess the same word twice.",

        "description": "This project involved the design and layout of three cookbook spreads using Adobe InDesign. I aimed to create a visually appealing and functional design that highlighted the food through large, high-quality images. The recipe page, placed opposite each dish’s image, featured clear and concise typography to present the recipe’s details, making it easy for readers to follow. I paid special attention to the hierarchy of information, using typography and spacing to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout. Additionally, including credits and personal statements from the recipe creator added a human touch to the cookbook, making it feel more personal and authentic.",

The front design, created in Adobe Illustrator, focused on a vibrant and dynamic visual that drew the viewer’s eye while evoking the experience of a live symphony performance. On the back of the poster, I used Adobe InDesign to organize and present the upcoming schedule of events. I ensured that the text was legible and well-structured, with clear sections for event names, dates, descriptions, and featured artists. The overall design aimed to engage the audience visually while providing essential information in an accessible format.",
